## Steps to Implement `useContext` and JWT Authentication in Next.js

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**

   - Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
   - Install necessary dependencies (`jose`, `axios`, etc.).

2. **Project Structure**

   - Organize the project with directories for components, contexts, pages, services, and utilities.

3. **Create JWT Utility Functions**

   - Implement functions for generating and verifying JWTs.

4. **Create Auth Context**

   - Create an `AuthContext` to manage authentication state.
   - Implement context provider with login and logout functions.

5. **Set Up API Routes**

   - Create API endpoints for login and logout.
   - Use the JWT utility functions to handle token generation and validation.

6. **Protect Routes**

   - Implement logic to protect routes, checking for valid JWTs.

7. **Update Components**

   - Create components to display user information.
   - Use the `AuthContext` to access and display authenticated user data.

8. **Client-Side Authentication**

   - Implement login forms and authentication flows on the client side.
   - Store and retrieve JWTs from localStorage.

9. **Integrate Context Provider**

   - Wrap the application with the `AuthProvider` in the `_app.tsx` file.

10. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Test authentication flows.
    - Debug and handle potential issues such as token expiration and invalid tokens.
